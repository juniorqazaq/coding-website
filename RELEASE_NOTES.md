## Release Description

### 🎨 Major UI Redesign ("Phitron" Style)
We have completely overhauled the Main Page to a unified **Blue Ecosystem** theme, cleaner typography, and interactive elements.

**Key Highlights:**
*   **New Hero Section:** Minimalist white background with centered "Build Your Foundation" typography and floating 3D glassmorphism icons (Python, Database, Code).
*   **Popular Courses Grid:** Replaced the scrolling marquee with a robust **Card Grid** layout, featuring custom "Neon Line Art" icons and detailed descriptions for C, HTML, Swift, PHP, Node, and Next.js.
*   **Dark-to-Light Transformation:** The platform now fully embraces a **Light Mode** aesthetic for better readability, with clean gray/white backgrounds replacing the previous dark theme.
*   **New Footer:** A "Developer-Themed" footer with monospace fonts, code syntax styling (`// Start`), and a streamlined contact form.
*   **Interactive CTA:** A deep navy `#0B1221` Call-to-Action section with a "New Batch" badge and clear entry points.

### ✨ New Features
*   **Student Testimonials:** Added a section featuring reviews from students to build trust.
*   **Registration Button:** Updated the specific navbar action to **Blue** to match the new brand identity.
*   **Explore Options:** Added dedicated "Explore All Courses" navigation paths.

### 🛠 Technical Improvements
*   **Component Modularity:** Refactored `Hero`, `PopularCourses`, `Testimonials`, and `CTA` into standalone, reusable components.
*   **Tailwind Architecture:** Standardized usage of `bg-blue-600` and `text-gray-900` across the application.
*   **Fixed Syntax Errors:** Resolved JSX closing tag issues in the Footer component.
